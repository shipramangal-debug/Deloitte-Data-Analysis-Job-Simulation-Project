# Deloitte Data Analytics Job Simulation

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Experience. The objective was to analyze organizational and operational data, apply business logic for classification, and build visual dashboards to support decision-making.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Processing & Classification (Excel)

- Analyzed equality scores across factories and job roles
- Applied logical functions (IF, AND, OR) to implement business rules
- Created an "Equality Class" column categorizing roles into:
  - Fair
  - Unfair
  - Highly Discriminative
- Automated classification based on defined score thresholds

This step demonstrates structured thinking and the ability to translate business conditions into data logic.

### 2. Data Visualization & Analysis (Tableau)

- Built an interactive dashboard to analyze factory performance
- Compared operational health status across multiple factories
- Visualized unhealthy device counts by device type
- Enabled factory-level comparison for operational risk assessment
- Presented insights through clear and structured visual layouts

This step demonstrates the ability to convert structured data into actionable visual insights.
